## Dendency-inversion principle Learning

This repository houses a simple React/Next.js/TypeScript application created for personal learning purposes. The app is designed to help me grasp and experiment with the Dependency Inversion Principle in frontend development. Through this project, I aim to deepen my understanding of the principle and its application within my own development workflow.
